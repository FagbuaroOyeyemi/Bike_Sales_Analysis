# Bike_Sales_Analysis
In this Project,I performed Data Wrangling using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn to clean and analyse bike sales dataset gotten from Kaggle. I tackled some data quality and tidiness issues in the dataset. After cleaning the dataset, I was able to analyze and visualize insights such as;
1. Age Distribution of Customers

3. Total Profit by Month
4. Average Orders by Month

6. Average Revenue by Year
